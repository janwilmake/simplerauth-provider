# Changelog

## 2025-06-27

Initial implementation based on GitHub OAuth client-provider pattern.

- âœ… Add `withSimplerAuth(handler,config?:{scope?:string})` fetch wrapper to have a one-liner that logs in if unauthenticated and passes user simple user-do access to ctx.
- âœ… Create minimal demo `withSimplerAuth`
- âœ… X OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow implementation
- âœ… Domain-based client identification (no registration required)
- âœ… MCP-compliant OAuth 2.0 server metadata endpoints
- âœ… Encrypted access token storage using Durable Objects
- âœ… Support for both direct login and OAuth provider flows

## 2025-08-15

- âœ… Turn users into a table
- âœ… Add multistub and queryable-object and enable admin login

## 2025-08-16

- ðŸ¤” Figure out if we should require a unique access_token per client-id (since we may wanna reuse it directly for api calls, it makes sense) **yes we do**
- âœ… Improved structure and README of this repo. A lot.
- âœ… Make admin truly read-only
- âœ… Create a new table `logins` that holds the access_token. Store x_access_token on the users, but access_token on the logins.
- âœ… Update datastructure
  - Create a new table `logins` that holds the access_token. Store x_access_token on the users, but access_token on the logins.
  - Ensure the access-token encodes and encrypts `user_id` as well as the `client_id` plus the x access token.
  - access*token format is of format simple*{encrypted_data} where the decrypted is in format `user_id:client_id:token` to keep it short. encrypted with env.X_CLIENT_SECRET. Now, each client has a different access tokens for each user, and there can be as many as required.
  - For all DO functions that affect either the logins or users table, use `user:${user_id}` for DO name. we can decrypt the access token to know the user_id
  - no backwards compatibility required
- âœ… Every new login would create a new unique login! To not overwrite other devices.
- âœ… Keep track of created at, updated at, and request_count in logins!!! Super valueable stats. The logic should be as follows:
  - upon /callback, set last_active_at.
  - when calling /me, if last_active_at is more than an hour old but less than 4 hours old, only update last_active_at. if last_active_at is more than 4 hours old, increment session_count (there was inactivity for >3 hours)
- âœ… Client needs `withSimplerAuth` implementation that uses arbitrary address for token exchange, not X.
- âœ… Change registered scopes in `simplerauth-client` to just `profile` (standard)

# TODO

AMBITION - SOLVE OAUTH ONCE AND FOR ALL! Use this by default unless specificaly disabled (flaredream).

- âœ… Change to use `simplerauth-client` in `universal-oauth-provider`
- âœ… Improve `simplerauth-client` so localhost development 'just works' (But is this secure to open up?) `Invalid client_id: must be a valid domain`. For localhost, getting invalid grant. Test `basedpeople` locally.
  - âœ… Added check to `env.PORT` and header check to see if ip is localhost loopback ip
  - âœ… Fixed client to set temporary cookies for redirect_uri and redirect_to to ensure we can send them to the token endpoint
- ðŸ¤” Specifically for basedpeople, doing a request to `ctx.user` every time makes this worker twice as expensive. Kinda wasteful, but is that important? Maybe, a cache to `/me` can be made configurable? Seems exessive to fetch it every time **Skip for now since this also tracks the user, which is something we want**
- Change in `markdownfeed` and test markdownfeed MCP with https://universal.simplerauth.com. Update `simplerauth-client` such that the 401 config is perfect and flow is 100% compatible!
- Confirm it's secure and complies with https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization and security best practices. Put a LMPIFY prompt in readme that shows this!
- Make it a `flaredream build` module that removes it from worker-custom code while still allowing for `wrangler dev`. More work required to allow for packages (can hardcode speicific single-file ones maybe, at first, to skip bundling still)
- Add it to `system[-ts].md`. Can even be without being a module for now, just package and proper buildscript and main entry should be configured.
- Add configuration `allowedClients` to restrict which clients can authorize.
- âœ… Create `@wilmakesystems` account with more subtle profile picture, and align the logo with that, so login comes over more trustworthy.

When all is well, do an announcement for the `simplerauth-client`.

## Scalability

- Figure out how I can reduce load on aggregate.
  - Cache `/me` from `simplerauth-client`?
  - Only connect to aggregate once per 15 minutes (from user DO, not exported handler?)
- Add per-client ratelimit (1200 requests per minute should do) to prevent capacity constraints and DDOS problems
- Write a section in readme about scalability and performance, and how this may improve in the future (moving DOs around)

## Content

- Lay out the concept of `domain-as-client-id` and explain MCP-recommended programmatic oauth flow.
- This is also great to share on X and with the team.

## Bonus

- Flaredream: When logged in, connect durable-worker with user-DO.
- Stripeflare must take user-ID and must be able to have metadata for payment callback with custom logic per metadata. May need different boundary.
- For admin, also expose `/query` and MCP for that
- Also expose `llms.txt` and `openapi.json` for the provider.

## Meeting Mv:

- Make standalone POC OAuth with all MCP stuff?
